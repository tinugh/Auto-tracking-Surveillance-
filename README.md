ðŸš¨ Restricted Area Face Tracking with PTZ Camera

This system is designed to monitor and track individuals entering a restricted area, such as a secured room or high-security zone. Using a PTZ-enabled IP camera, the system detects faces, automatically pans/tilts to center them, zooms in, captures a snapshot, and saves the full annotated video for record-keeping or alerting.
